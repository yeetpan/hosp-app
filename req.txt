✅ Features of This Helper Method
Nested Loops: Characters per account, words per account, and cross-account character comparisons.
Collections:
Lists: all words, temporary logging list
Sets: unique names, unique words, unique characters
Maps: Id->Name, Name->Count, Name->Character List, Name->Word Set
Reusability: Can be called from multiple main methods (loadAccountsDynamicSOQL, groupAccountsByIndustry, etc.).
Debugging Practice: Step-by-step debug for every collection and nested loop.
Trainee Practice: Students can implement each step as a separate operation and understand how nested collections work in Apex.
